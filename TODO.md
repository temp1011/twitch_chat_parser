TODO
- errors
- split up modules more
- websocket backend
- use multiple clients for better parallel
- investigate vods. website still seems to join irc channel but may just be for sending messages...
- there are too many types named message and the conversions between them are messy. Use a better deserializer for at least the tags and try and remove a layer.
